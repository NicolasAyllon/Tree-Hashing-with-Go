Hello!

I found this assignment quite challenging, as there was a lot to learn to
get off the ground with Go, but it was ultimately exciting to get everything working!

For parallelizing tree comparisons, I decided to assign goroutines hashes
instead of (tree1, tree2) pairs, so this would work better on fine.txt.

Thank you,

-Nicolas
