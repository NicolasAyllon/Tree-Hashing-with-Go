Hello!

I found this assignment quite challenging, as there was a lot to learn to
even get off the ground with Go.

For parallelizing tree comparisons, I decided to assign goroutines hashes
instead of (tree1, tree2) pairs, so this would work better on fine.txt.

Since previous labs asked to report the total time spent, I will estimate this
lab was about 70 hours. 

I still wish to complete the course and will do my best.

Thank you,

-Nicolas
